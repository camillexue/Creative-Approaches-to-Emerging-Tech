The Internet With a Human Face reading was much more thought provoking and definitely made me consider the internet and personal data in a different way. In the class so far when we’ve talked about the dangers of data, I still wasn’t really convinced that my own data personally would be that damaging if people collected every little thing about me. I thought that because I am average and boring, my data couldn’t possibly incriminate me in any way, so it couldn’t really be that bad, right? 

The example given about the “pink files” made me realize how bad it could be. Maybe something about being put on a list makes it seem particularly terrifying, because I’m not even sure what list I could be on that would warrant a company collecting all of my personal information. Back then, homsexuality was viewed very differently than it is today, so of course now I think it’s crazy that people would even think about making a collection of pink files. I wonder what the equivalent thing is for right now that people are keeping track of without us knowing that in the future would seem like a huge violation of human rights.

The internet overall just seems like it is just an insanely powerful tool for companies to use and take advantage of in order to gather data about us, and I know that they already do. Of his points about ideas on where to begin regulation, the one that I wish were true the most is number 4, which says, “If a website collects information about me, I should be allowed to see it.” I think I should definitely already be able to know this, and now that I have read this, I am kind of annoyed that this isn’t already the case.
