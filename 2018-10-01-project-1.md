Data Shots is a personal, data art piece which was made to emulate some of the key features of the project Dear Data by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec. Specifically, the project captures the personal nature, visual appeal, and analog form of Dear Data.

In order to add my own take on the ideas presented as well as adjust the project to fit time and resource constraints, I changed some key aspects of the project. Instead of using postcards to transfer of data between two people as a way of building a relationship, Data Shots uses polaroid pictures to create more of a stand-alone self portrait.

I collected data about things I did over 6 days, and created physical representations of each one. Knowing that I would be representing my data in this way, I kept track of data that was countable. Since I was limited to much less time and keeping track of more things, I knew I wouldnâ€™t be able to keep track of the different details associated with every data point like Lupi and Posavec did in Dear Data. 

Once I collected all my data, I thought about what I wanted to use to represent each category. I wanted them to be somewhat related to whatever they were representing, so that required some planning beforehand, but once I knew that, creating the physical representations was fairly straightforward. These scenes were then photographed, framed as polaroid pictures, and hung up on thread, similar to how photos of friends or family might be hung up in a dorm room.

For example, for the Pieces of Paper Used photo, origami cranes were used to represent each sheet of paper I used in 6 days. Since polaroid cameras are somewhat finicky, and polaroid film is expensive, I used her iPhone camera to take the pictures to ensure that I would get the perfect shot. These pictures were then placed on actual polaroid pictures in order to emulate the same classic, analog feel of the postcards used in Dear Data.

Besides wanting to share about my own life through Data Shots, I created wanted to show people that data can be represented in many different ways. I was hoping that it would make them consider what their own data self portraits would look like, what story their data would tell.
