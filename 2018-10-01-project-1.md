*Data Shots* is a personal, data art piece created by Camille Xue. She aimed to emulate some of the key features of the project *Dear Data* by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec. Specifically, the project captures the personal nature, visual appeal, and analog form of *Dear Data*. 

In order to add her own take on the ideas presented as well as adjust the project to fit time and resource constraints, Camille changed some key aspects of the project. Instead of using postcards to transfer of data between two people as a way of building a relationship, *Data Shots* uses polaroid pictures to create more of a stand-alone self portrait.

She collected data about things she did over 6 days, and created physical representations of each one. These were then photographed, framed as polaroid pictures, and hung up on thread, similar to how photos of friends or family might be hung up in a dorm room. 

For example, for the Pieces of Paper Used photo, origami cranes were used to represent each sheet of paper she used in 6 days. Since polaroid cameras are somewhat finicky, and polaroid film is expensive, Camille used her iPhone camera to take the pictures to ensure that she would get the perfect shot. These pictures were then placed on actual polaroid pictures in order to emulate the same classic, analog feel of the postcards used in *Dear Data*.

Besides wanting to share about her own life through *Data Shots*, Camille created this project hoping that it would show people that data can be represented in many different ways and to make them consider what their own data self portraits would look like.
