For our final project, we wanted to focus on the rapid spread of disinformation online. The existence of the internet creates the forum for disinformation, and you cannot have an internet where there is not disinformation at all. People will always spread false or misleading information, especially online where anonymity gives them more distance between their words and themselves. Not only is false information an inherent part of the internet, the capitalist nature of the internet almost encourages it, and this is what we wanted to highlight in our project Wildfire.

In Wildfire, the player is given an input box where they enter a statement. It could be anything from “I like blueberries” to “Cell phones give you cancer.” The goal of the game is to get spread your message as much as possible within a set time frame. Our game is built so that more controversial or misleading or negative messages get spread faster. The type of messages that would serve as good clickbait would spread very quickly. 

The goal is for the player to realize what phrases, words, and messages spread the fastest and are most likely to go viral because that will allow them to win the game. By the design of the game, they will be rewarded for disinformation that is particularly provocative, inflammatory, or controversial. This is meant to mimic how these types of pieces of information are what go viral and are sensationalized on the internet. There is a monetary incentive to write misleading clickbait titles or to tweet obviously false things because they are more likely to get clicks and views. In our game, the incentive is the score and the ranking. 

We created a demo video of our game since were not able to actually create the game ourselves. In our video we show three different types of messages to show the differences in how much they spread based on what they are. The message mentioning “Donald Trump” received the highest score of 1852, reaching the maximum amount of people and getting the rank of Viral.

The results page of the game is also intended to highlight some of the consequences of spreading false information. The player might not have any personal stake in the message they enter, but the goal is that once they see: “562 people now believe that vaccines cause autism” as a result of the message they sent, they will feel more accountable for the message they wrote. The goal for this metric is to make them rethink what they themselves say when they go online. Spreading false information might seem like a fun joke or might seem profitable but it can have real effects and consequences.
