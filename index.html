        <h1>Bad Writer: Response</h1>

        <p>While I was reading Bad Writer, all I could think about was how bad I am at writing. In general, I agree with the definition of bad writing that Ahmad presents in this piece, so most of my thoughts were about how it applies to me. I never thought I was great at writing, but now I am pretty sure I would be classified as a “bad writer” according to Michael Mohammed Ahmad. Even though there were plenty of examples of bad writing in the piece, I still don’t feel like I could distinguish bad writing from good writing. I don’t know what phrases are cliche or are bad metaphors. I also felt particularly bad when I read the line about what you read as food for you as a writer. I don’t read. My writer diet is nonexistent. 
        </p>
        <p>To be perfectly honest, I’m now really self conscious about even writing this blog response to the piece. I don’t want to be a bad writer or do anything wrong, but I really don’t know what to do to improve. One of the other points that stuck out to me in Bad Writer was how Ahmad viewed constructive criticism. As a concept, I’m all for constructive criticism, but in practice, I would definitely be one of those people who would cry upon receiving it. Plus, all the criticism that Ahmad described seemed really harsh, which I know I would not be able to take well. 
        </p>
       <p>Overall, I found myself agreeing with Ahmad while I read the piece, but for the most part I was just thinking: Oh man. That’s me. I’m a bad writer. Oof.
