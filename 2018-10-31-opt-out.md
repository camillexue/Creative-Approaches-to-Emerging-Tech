title: Opt-Out of the Internet
---

OCT. 31 2018

It’s almost impossible to not have a single trace of you on the internet. If you have an email, you’re on the internet. If a friend posts a photo of you on facebook, you’re on the internet. If you subscribe to Netflix, you’re on the internet. If you decided to walk away from it all, to delete your presence from the internet, could you do it?

### Opt-Out:

Opt-Out imagines what that process could look like. A user would simply provide their email address, their name, and a photo of themselves and Tabula Rasa would do the rest for them. It would find any accounts or subscriptions linked to that email or name and delete them. Using the photo, it would use facial recognition and scour the internet for any photos of the user. It would delete the photo if it was the user’s upload, or if it was a photo someone else uploaded, it would censor the image. 

After the erasing process was complete, the user would have the ability to view the report of exactly what was deleted. In our example, Christian had over 100 accounts that would have to be deleted in order to completely remove him from the internet. Our goal with the report was to show the sheer number of accounts that are linked to a person because deleting those 100+ accounts by hand would be a huge undertaking. 

There’s also the option to see the censored images on the report, which shows what other people will see when they’re scrolling through facebook for example. Our goal with the images part of the report was to show the contrast between how many photos a user has direct control over and can just delete and how many photos exist that they wouldn’t be able to do anything about because they didn’t upload the image. There are far more of the latter, which again would make doing this opt-out process today almost impossible to do. 

Finally, the user is presented with a congratulations message on being removed from the internet. Tabula Rasa would continue the censoring process until the user decided to opt back into the internet, so the user can be stress-free in the knowledge that they definitely don’t have a single trace of them on the internet. They have complete control over their online presence and existence.

### The Process:

We simulated the website using images created in Illustrator, and we manually went through each image to censor them in Photoshop. Finding all of the accounts was more of an involved process, and we found that there were far more accounts than we originally anticipated. To find them, we looked through his email, looked on his phone for mobile apps, looked through his browser’s remembered passwords, and googled something like “Top 100 Subscription Services.”

We faked the website by creating html files that just contained images that were linked to the next page, which was also an image. The form was created on an external website, and the loading bar was made in After Effects. The form and loading bar were separate videos that were stitched in during video editing.

Basically the answer to our question of “Could you opt out of the internet if you wanted to?’ is no. There are so many accounts that it would be largely impractical to go through them one by one to delete them all, and there’s no real way of making sure you got every single account. There’s also types of accounts like emails or online bank accounts that couldn’t be deleted if you wanted to be a functioning member of society. Finally, there’s the aspect of things online about you that you don’t have control over. Whether it’s other people uploading images of you or companies recording data about you, you don’t get to decide if it’s online or not.
