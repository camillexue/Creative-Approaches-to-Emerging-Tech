There is no standard rule for whether a dataset is trustworthy or not, but there’s good places to look to determine if it is or not. Behind every dataset there is some form of collection that had to take place and some way that it is presented. This is where people have to look when determining whether they can trust a dataset or not. By asking, who collected the data and how, you can decide for yourself how credible and accurate the data is. Similarly, people have to look at how the data is presented since sometimes this is where the data can become skewed in a way that distorts the truth. Although the data itself might not be incorrect, the presentation might emphasize certain things or highlight patterns that aren’t there. Behind the presentation there is a person making a choice, and that presents more interpretation and subjectivity for the dataset. 

Even if data is interpreted, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s less useful, meaningful, or true, than if it was 100% objective. For practical reasons, people have to treat data as if it is completely objective. Assuming the source of the data, the collection method, and the form or presentation of the data seems reasonably sound, the dataset can be considered trustworthy. This level of truth should be enough for the data to then be used and analyzed. The data doesn’t exist in a void; there is some context or world that it lives in, and within this subset of the universe, the data can be considered objective. 
Data can reflect a number of different realities at once in the sense that the same dataset can tell different stories depending on how you read it. The same data points could be interpreted in different ways, given different meanings, which could be considered reflecting different realities. 

I don’t believe there is anything that exists in our world that is truly objective or true, and data is no exception. Despite this lack of “objective truth,” data can still be used effectively with whatever lesser truth it does have, and for me that’s all that matters.
